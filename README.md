Editor for Wicked Engine

Started development of an editor for the engine...

Documentation is not available yet.

To build it, you will need to have visual studio 2015 and you must also link with the wicked engine.

The binary (exe) is also available for windows, so you can just try it out (WickedEngineEditor folder). You can load any of the demos from WickedEngineDemos project: https://github.com/turanszkij/WickedEngineDemos
